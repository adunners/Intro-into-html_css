        <h1 class="heading-font">Who is Bluey?</h1>
        <p class="paragraph-on-bluey">Bluey is a deep blue Ford Transit. Born in 2008 and worked for British Gas for many years! Coming to the peoples aid, when in dire straits, to rescue their heating problem.
        In 2021 she was converted into a campervan and purchased by Alex Dunne and his wife to venture Europe in.
        </p>
        <h2 class="heading-font">How did Bluey manage on a European trip?</h2>
        <p>Before setting off she had a awning and a shower installed and spent 6 weeks in the garage having a much needed bit of TLC. So typically after all this pampering she broke down on the second day!</p>
